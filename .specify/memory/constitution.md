# Digger Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Native Performance First
All features MUST prioritize native Vala implementation over external dependencies; Performance optimizations MUST be measurable and documented; Memory usage MUST remain minimal and efficient for desktop applications.

The foundation of Digger's architecture rests on delivering optimal performance through native code. This ensures responsive user interactions, minimal resource consumption, and seamless integration with the GNOME ecosystem.

### II. Modern GNOME Integration
All UI components MUST use GTK4 and libadwaita patterns; Design MUST follow GNOME Human Interface Guidelines; Features MUST support adaptive layouts and modern desktop paradigms.

Digger provides a cohesive experience within the GNOME desktop environment through consistent design patterns, adaptive interfaces, and adherence to established usability principles.

### III. Self-Contained Distribution
All dependencies MUST be embedded within Flatpak packages; External system tools MUST be bundled or avoided; Distribution MUST NOT require additional package installations.

Ensuring reliable deployment across diverse Linux distributions requires complete self-containment. This principle eliminates dependency conflicts and provides consistent functionality regardless of the host system configuration.

### IV. Comprehensive Testing
All new features MUST include unit and integration tests; DNS query functionality MUST be tested against multiple scenarios; UI interactions MUST be validated through automated testing where possible.

Quality assurance through systematic testing prevents regressions, validates functionality across diverse network environments, and maintains reliability as the codebase evolves.

### V. User-Centric Design
All features MUST solve real DNS lookup workflow problems; UI complexity MUST be justified by user value; Performance improvements MUST be perceptible to end users.

Every design decision prioritizes practical utility for network administrators, developers, and system administrators who rely on DNS diagnostic tools in their daily workflows.

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
All code MUST follow established Vala conventions and best practices; Memory management MUST be explicit and leak-free; Error handling MUST provide meaningful feedback to users; Documentation MUST explain complex DNS parsing logic and network interactions.

Quality standards ensure maintainable, reliable code that can be safely modified and extended by current and future contributors.

### Testing Requirements
All DNS query types MUST have comprehensive test coverage; Network failure scenarios MUST be tested and handled gracefully; UI state management MUST be validated through interaction testing; Build processes MUST include automated quality checks.

Robust testing practices prevent functionality regressions and ensure reliable behavior across diverse network environments and system configurations.

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
All new features MUST begin with user requirement specification; Implementation MUST follow test-driven development principles; Code reviews MUST verify adherence to constitutional principles; Integration MUST include performance impact assessment.

Structured development processes ensure feature quality, architectural consistency, and alignment with project goals while maintaining development velocity.

### Release Management
All releases MUST include comprehensive testing on target platforms; Version increments MUST follow semantic versioning principles; Release notes MUST clearly communicate user-facing changes; Distribution updates MUST be coordinated across Flatpak channels.

Reliable release processes ensure users receive stable, well-tested software with clear upgrade paths and minimal disruption to existing workflows.

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines; All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles; Complexity that cannot be justified within these principles MUST be simplified or rejected; Amendments require documentation of rationale, community review, and migration planning.

### Amendment Process
Constitutional changes require explicit documentation of the change rationale; Community discussion period of at least one week for major amendments; Implementation plan for adapting existing code to new principles; Version increment following semantic versioning rules.

### Compliance Review
All development activities MUST align with constitutional principles; Regular architecture reviews MUST assess adherence to performance and quality standards; Non-compliance MUST be addressed before feature acceptance; Project maintainers MUST ensure constitutional enforcement.
